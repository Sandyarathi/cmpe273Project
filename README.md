# cmpe273Project
The app was designed to fetch most popular Facebook posts (including photos, videos, status, check-in, etc.) 
of every month for the user who uses this app. The app was focused on leveraging Facebook’s REST API to develop an 
application to post content onto the logged in user’s wall or Facebook page, display the top 5 posts of the every month 
based on the rating given to each post based on likes, comments, shares, etc. It also displays the common photos between the 
logged-in user and friends tagged in the top posts. The project was built on RestFul Web Services using content type as JSON 
for returning all responses.
